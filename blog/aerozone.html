          <h1>Product Request: AeroZone</h1>
          <div>October 19, 2020</div>

          <div class="postBody">An interesting product that should exist is the AeroZone: A personal, portable environment.

            <img class="aerozone" src="../images/aerozone.png"/>

            The AeroZone is a controlled environment for each person, which features:
            <ul>
              <li>Temperature control to simulate cold, normal, and hot weather conditions</li>
              <li>Protective shielding for the user using the high pressure air layers</li>
              <li>Seamless and smart interaction with the outside environment</li>
            </ul>
            This product solves the age old problem of not being ready for the environment, and being able to adapt to any conditions.

            The temperature control allows users to be in their comfort zone, allowing the freedom to wear their preferred fashion and outfits, regardless of the weather. Want to rock shorts in the Winter? Now everyone can! This avoids having to wear  bulky clothes, and having to suffer the extremes of too hot or too cold.

            This portable zone also carries utility in never needing an umbrella again as it shields the user from outside environment.  Rain, snow, and harmful UV rays are only a worry of the past. Air is also a part of the environment already, and not too dangerous for the user to interact with. Especially with COVID and the spread of diseases an important concern as of late, the AeroZone can help protect individuals by isolating them in a personal 'bubble' and also protect from the outside.

            The seamless and smart interaction with the outside environment would allow the user to complete everyday tasks and interactions as normal, providing the user with a thin and conforming layer of air for minimal protection. Contact with surfaces and others will also sanitize beforehand as they pass through the zone.

            It is imagined that this zone would originate from a backpack of some sort, containing the technology to generate this barrier.

            Overall, this product can help deliver more freedom to people, allowing them to explore more of the world. Future improvements can include more portability, such as by integrating it with clothing (hat, shirt, glasses, etc.). Since the product has so much utility as well, it is important to acquire economies of scale and scope in order to bring costs down and deliver it to as many people as possible. The AeroZone can also use integrations with many existing wearables such as watches, and contain settings that can be tweaked using a mobile app. Integrations with voice assistants will also make the product more user-friendly.
