# arriye.me

This is my personal site for displaying my work and projects!

## Inspiration
I wanted an easy way to display my work and projects, and to allow people to easily find me to network. Building a website was the first thing I learned to code, and I wanted to expand on my HTML/CSS/JS learning for getting into frontend development!

## What it does
Displays a responsive site with my contact links, basic info about me, and links to my projects and resume.

## How I built it
HTML5UP for the responsive template, then I tweaked code here and there to fit my purposes. Added graph tags, links to all my contact points, a top button to help the user experience, and played with the style a bit.


## Challenges I ran into
Displaying links properly, displaying open graph tags properly, learning markdown, rounding out headshot, making style consistent.


## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Hosted my own website, learned HTML/CSS/JS and have something to show friends and family!

## What I learned
Opengraph tags, HTML/CSS/JS

## What's next for arriye.me
Adding more links, reformatting design and adding sections to display my interests, blog, etc.
